        <p class="experiencia">
          As a Cloud Services Engineer, I specialize in designing, implementing,
          and managing cloud-based solutions for my clients and colleagues. I
          have extensive experience in this area, focusing primarily on Azure
          Active Directory. One of my primary responsibilities is configuring
          and managing user access and identity management, ensuring that my
          clients' sensitive data is kept secure and only accessible by
          authorized individuals. Another area excels in is Azure Monitoring and
          Automation. Previously I worked with my clients to optimize their
          resources and improve their cloud security, helping them get the most
          out of their cloud solutions. This involves creating custom monitoring
          solutions that provide my clients with real-time information about
          their cloud infrastructure, allowing them to make informed decisions
          about resource allocation and usage. Having completed a Cisco IT
          Essentials course, I am proficient in troubleshooting, maintaining,
          using, and supporting computer systems and networks. In addition, I
          have completed an Azure Bootcamp, which has given me hands-on
          experience in deploying, managing, and monitoring cloud applications.
          Finally, I am interested in cloud technologies and advanced
          development with artificial intelligence. Beyond my professional life,
          I am a great basketball player. Playing basketball helps me stay
          physically active and mentally fresh, which is crucial in a fast-paced
          industry like cloud services. I also believe strongly in lifelong
          learning and am dedicated to continually expanding my knowledge and
          skills. As a result, I stay abreast of the latest industry trends and
          technologies, which allows me to offer my clients the best possible
          solutions to meet their needs.
